We have a tendency to get stuck in our own context. Maybe that means that we live within our own culture or norms; maybe it means we live within our own particular understanding of the world. When we look at a thing, we are wont to perceive in a particular way -- a particular way that usually conforms to the norms of our enviornment.

To be clear, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this. You might even go so far as to call it helpful. After all, it allows you to reduce the cognitive complexity of everyday life. You can focus more on the tasks in front of you and do better at executing them.

But learning a new language is an escape hatch. Language gives us tool to interpret the complexities of life in a way that we can understand, and every language provides us with a new way to do that. 

## Why read?

But why reading exactly? Well, look at the alternatives. 

We can study from textbooks and do exercises in workbooks. This is helpful in a mechanical way, and without it we can’t get too far. The problem here though is that it’s dry and often only engaging with the help of a teacher. 

We can have conversation practice, and this is also an excellent way to open new doors. But it can be hard to find the partners in general or just the right speaking partner. Even if you do, there’s then the question of what to talk about. 

I don’t see reading in a foreign language as an alternative to these things, but it’s something that can enrich them. It can give you something to talk about. It can give you the vocabulary you need to express yourself. And at the intersection of language and literature, there’s a never-ending <Def content=“an original and plentiful source”user={user} location={path}>wellspring</Def> of worlds to uncover. 

Join me across these following stories. I’ll include questions to check your understanding and annotate the text, either simply with additional information (like the first sentence on this page), or with vocabulary you can save and view in your <a href={`/profile?ID=${user}`}>user profile</a> (like the word “wellspring” above). 

Let’s go?
