We have a tendency to get stuck in our own context. Maybe that means that we live within our own culture or norms; maybe it means we live within our own particular understanding of the world. When we look at a thing, we are wont to perceive in a particular way -- a particular way that usually conforms to the norms of our enviornment.

To be clear, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this. You might even go so far as to call it helpful. After all, it allows you to reduce the cognitive complexity of everyday life. You can focus more on the tasks in front of you and do better at executing them.

But learning a new language is an escape hatch.
