When Dave Long tagged up and tried for third, everyone had to laugh. A bonehead move, and, for Dave—typically a **prudent** guy—uncharacteristic. As he took off, Dave laughed, too, at his own folly. Church-league softball, one gone in the last inning, not a blessed thing on the line—the game was without meaning and out of reach—and he went on a shallow fly to left.

“Good Lord,” his wife, Susan, said to the woman next to her. She was sitting in the aluminum bleachers with the rest of the Bethany Baptist bunch. She had arrived late—barely in time to see Dave reach second on an overthrow. He was surprised to see her. Susan Long was a busy, charitable woman. She worked half time keeping the books for Nunez Chiropractic and gave her afternoons and evenings to business of the church, the school, the community. Before the game, Dave and his son, Randy, grabbed some food downtown—as they did two or three times a week. Given her responsibilities at the church, which included a leadership role in Christian education, her several Bible-studies and support groups, her involvement in such service arms as Member Care and Prayer Chain and Meals on Wheels, Susan had little time to prepare supper, or eat it. “What the heck is he doing?” she said.

Dave was trying for third. There was no question: he knew he should stay at second, he should not go, and he went. The left fielder, Pastor Jeff, of the Alliance Church, had a cannon. He looked at Dave as if Dave were pursued by demons. Pastor Jeff spoke to him. In shallow left field he was close enough to speak to Dave as he headed for third.

“Where are you going, Dave?” Pastor Jeff said. “You’re dead, man.”

Dave smiled. He liked Pastor Jeff. On the street. He hadn’t cared for his manner in the pulpit, the few times he’d heard him preach. Pastor Jeff was too tall—he was six feet nine—and his preaching posture was stooped and **condescending**. He was also too familiar and digressive for Dave, who had been raised in the cooler, straighter logic of the Episcopalians. But Pastor Jeff had the straight truth here: Dave _was_ dead. To rights. Dave had been fast, but he was forty-four now, and he was too slow to pull this sort of stunt.

Dave’s son, his only child, Randy, stood a way off, down the third-base line, behind the Cyclone fence. He was hanging from the fence as if tethered there, his arms stretched out above his head, his fingers laced through the wire, the toes of his sneakers wedged in the bottommost holes. He shook his head back and forth, almost violently. Randy was thirteen. He had not wanted to come watch his father play.

“God,” he said when Dave tagged up. “Stupid. You’re stupid.”

Randy was a big, strong kid. He was, almost all the time now, angry at his father. He could tolerate his mother, but everything about Dave, who you would have thought the more approachable parent, enraged him.

Randy hated the way Dave dressed. He hated his whole wardrobe, in particular a blue down jacket Dave had had for years and wore when he drove Randy to school on winter mornings.

“You garbageman,” Randy would say to him. “You look like a garbageman. You grunge monkey.”

Dave liked this latter expression; he tried not to smile.

“Laugh,” Randy said. “Laugh. The garbagemen dress better than you do.” Dave’s beard, which he kept respectably trimmed, made Randy angry. “No kisses, wolfman,” Randy said, if Dave bent over his bed to kiss him good night. “You werewolf. You’re scaring me, wolfman.”

Randy spoke with stage disdain of Dave’s friends. Dave’s car, a Taurus wagon, was boring and dumb—for Randy, an emblem of all that was insufferable and pedestrian about his father. But the thing that really drove Randy wild was that Dave liked to read. Dave rose every morning at five so he could spend a quiet hour reading and thinking and praying. Which left him irredeemable in Randy’s eyes. If Dave sent Randy to his room or otherwise disciplined him—this happened more often than Dave wanted—Randy would say, in his cruelest, most hateful voice, “Why don’t you just go read a book, Mr. Reading Man. Mr. Vocabulary. Go pray, you praying mantis.”

Watching Randy, in his father’s presence—the way his face went tight, the way his back stiffened—listening to the explosive, primitive noises he made in place of speech, you could see the boy’s anger was beyond his control and understanding. It had sandbagged the kid, hit him blind side. It made Dave very sad. He missed the easy love of his son. He missed talking to Randy, he missed his companionship, and he felt sorry for him, because in the periodic rests between the rage, when he took breath, Randy was clearly dazed and spent and, himself, sad.

Sometimes it was hard for Dave to remember that this **abrasive**, scowling thing, always coming at him, was his own son. Randy would bump him or leer or growl, make some foul and belligerent gesture, and before he’d had time to set or check himself, Dave would have responded in kind. “You shut your mouth, punk, or I’ll shut it for you,” Dave might say. He would grab Randy’s arm above the elbow and squeeze it hard, trying to hurt him, and he would fill with regret and shame.

Randy said, “Stupid. You’re stupid,” and Dave, slow but hellbent for third, heard him.

Shoot, Dave thought. Poor kid. What am I doing?

Pastor Jeff threw a rope to the third baseman, also named Jeff, who worked in the auto-salvage yard. This layman Jeff caught the ball and straddled the bag, waiting for Dave, who was still only halfway there.

“Dumb,” Randy said. “You are stupid.” He untangled himself from the fence and turned his back to the field.

The third-base coach, Pastor Rick, senior pastor at Bethany Baptist, was at a loss. When the ball left the bat, a weak fly, he had raised his hands, palms out, signaling Dave to stay put. “Hold up, Gomer,” he shouted, but it was too late—Dave had committed himself.

Pastor Rick was Dave’s age. They met downtown once a week for lunch to discuss Scripture and Dave’s personal journey in faith. They had that day, over turkey melts and iced tea, considered Matthew 7:13-14, a familiar passage Dave had lately found compelling and vexing: “Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.” After a space of silent meditation, Pastor Rick asked Dave what he thought the Gospel writer might have meant by the word “narrow.” They had their Bibles on the table before them.

“Apart from the obvious?” Dave said.

“Yes,” said Pastor Rick. “Are you asking because you know, or because you want to know?”

“The second,” Pastor Rick said. “I don’t know. How would I know?”

“You’re Baptist.”

“No shit,” Pastor Rick said.

“If we knew what the Hebrew was,” Dave said. “Or the Greek.”

“Good question. I don’t. So?”

Dave thought a moment.

“Maybe as in **severe**,” he said. “I don’t know. Narrow. As in pinched. It pinches you to go through. What’s the word? Straits. Straitened. Maybe exclusive. Most people are excluded. They are left out. Unpopular. Maybe narrow as in simple. Sheer. Simple. Severe. Did I already say that?”

“Yes, you did.”

“Yeah, well that’s what I come up with.”

“Good stuff,” Pastor Rick said.

“What have you got?” Dave said.

“Half my sermon. Thanks.”

A female fan on the Bethany side was yelling, “Slide, Dave, slide!” This was a joke, because no one slid in church league—the guys were too old, too sedate—and, besides, Dave was wearing shorts. Everyone laughed. Dave heard the call for him to slide, and he, too, found the proposition laughable.

Then he slid. He raised his right hand in a fist. He yelled, “Oh, mama!” And from six feet away, and at what was for him top speed, he slid into third. Under the tag. Around the tag, really. No one who watched could believe it. It was the best, the only hook slide anyone had ever seen in that church league.

The base paths were a hard, dry, gravelly dirt, and Dave tore up his leg. He stood up, called time, and limped off the bag. He looked down at his leg, the left, which was badly torn from ankle to knee. Beneath a thin film of dirt, which Dave tried to wipe off with his hand, the leg was **livid**, strawberry, a crosshatch of ruts and gashes, bits of sand and gravel in the wounds.

Pastor Rick was beside him. He put his arm around Dave.

“Why did you do that?” Dave said. “Ouch.”

“Wild man. You okay?” Pastor Rick said. “Nice slide.”

“Thanks. I’m okay I think.”

“Can you walk? You want a runner?”

“Nah,” Dave said. “I’m fine.”

“You sure?”

“Yeah,” Dave said.

Pastor Rick patted Dave on the rump. “All right, then. Go get ‘em.”

Dave turned to the crowd. He smiled **sheepishly** and waved.

Susan stood up in the stands.

“I’m okay,” he said.

“Big jerk,” she said to herself as she sat down. Then, to the woman next to her, “I don’t believe it.” She took a magazine out of her purse and looked at the cover. She stood up. She shook the magazine at Dave. He pretended to cower, and the crowd laughed.

Randy, who had wheeled to watch the play from the left-field foul line, was embarrassed: that his father slid; that his father slid in shorts and hurt himself sliding; that the slide, in this context—a game for coots and feebs and wacko fundamentalists—was inordinately, ridiculously good; and, on top of it all, that his mother had got into this bad circus act. Randy began to drift in his father’s direction, up the line. Dave watched with gratitude and wonder. He looked at Randy, shrugged his shoulders, and smiled, a bit goofily.

It was only when Dave smiled at him that Randy realized he was moving toward his father. He pulled himself away. Randy turned and headed for the parking lot.

Dave’s leg looked bad, painful, but it didn’t really begin to hurt until after the next batter, Lloyd Weeks, who worked for Dave at the cereal plant, tapped a ground ball to the pitcher, stranding Dave at third and rendering perfectly pointless his miracle slide.

  
Randy caught a ride with his mother, who left as soon as the game ended, taking time only to tell Dave to get home and clean up his leg. To give Randy some time for his anger, Dave stayed to help gather the equipment, then wound up going for a beer with Pastor Rick and a few of the men. His leg was stinging. He doused it with cold water from a spigot by the backstop. At Tiny’s, he ordered a beer and a Scotch. He poured out the Scotch on his napkin and swabbed his leg.

“Shoot,” Dave said. “That stings.”

“That is one ugly leg,” said Pastor Rick.

Pastor Jeff of the Alliance Church held up his Diet Coke and shook it. “Just for the record,” he said. “And if anyone asks, I wasn’t here.”

“Who was?” said Pastor Rick.

“Great slide,” said Pastor Jeff to Dave. “I had you nailed.”

“Never in doubt,” Dave said.

Dave nursed his beer, listening to Pastor Rick and Pastor Jeff disagree about glossolalia and about the dangers (Pastor Jeff) and appeals (Pastor Rick) of ecumenism, and then **commiserate** about the demands of the lectionary.

“You write me this week’s,” said Pastor Rick. “I’ll give you half the take.”

“I’ll do it for nothing,” said Pastor Jeff. “You preach what I write.”

“Sure, sure,” said Pastor Rick. He looked over at Dave. “My guys couldn’t handle it.”

“Talk about speaking in tongues,” Dave said.

Pastor Jeff laughed, then sat up very straight.

“I cast thee out, little feller,” he said to Dave.

“I was just leaving,” Dave said.

When Dave got home it was half past nine, and Susan was already asleep. Randy was closed up in his room listening to his music. Dave stood outside the door. Randy had the volume down, but Dave could still feel in his feet the pulse of the bass and the drum. It was a song he knew.

_They_

_They betray_

_I’m your true friend now_

_They_

_They’ll betray_

_I’m forever there_

  
He knew the song, he knew the CD. Metallica. Randy played it often and loud, and Dave had listened to it several times, on his own, when Randy wasn’t around.

_Hate_

_I’m your hate_

_I’m your hate when you want love_

  
The boy had taste. This music was virtuoso stuff, and Dave thought it might lead him to other forms. But the lyrics, which seemed to speak to Randy so nearly—the spirit, pitch-dark and bereft, to which Randy vibrated with such sympathy—made Dave unhappy and fearful. He’d told Randy, once, that he liked the music.

Randy needed no time to work into his rage. “You don’t like it. You don’t know anything about it. You’ve never even heard it.”

“I’ve heard it,” Dave said, backing off. “I think it’s good. Forget it.”

“You don’t know anything,” Randy said. “Keep out of my room. Don’t touch my stuff.”

Dave showered, and dabbed his leg with a soapy washcloth. The injury was worse than he’d thought. There was almost no skin left on the wound, which covered a sizable portion of the leg, from the ankle to the knee. It looked as if someone had gone at his leg with a cheese grater. The tissue around the place was pink and swollen. When they were clean, they would not stop bleeding. The blood didn’t flow so much as pool up, and he used a roll of toilet paper trying to stop it. When it still would not stop, he wrapped his lower leg tightly in some gauze bandage he dug out of the vanity drawer and fastened that with adhesive tape. Almost at once, his leg began to **throb**. It felt hot. It was already infected, he figured. He lay down on the living-room couch and elevated his leg with a cushion. After a few minutes the blood had seeped through the gauze, and Dave gingerly removed it. There would be no way to stitch the thing—the surface area was far too large and irregular. He thought about going over to the emergency room. Instead, he boiled some water in a pot. He soaked a fresh dish towel in the water, lifted it out with salad tongs, and, thinking to cauterize the wound, applied it to his leg. It burned him. He cried out but held the towel to his leg as long as he could bear to.

Then he sat down on the kitchen floor, his left leg stretched out before him, and prayed.

He rarely thought about praying. Most often it was a moment in which he gave thanks or stilled himself to listen for guidance. He shied from begging prayer. With all he had, it felt unfair to ask for more. This night, his leg hurting to the bone, he permitted himself a request.

“Father,” he said quietly, “please help me to see what I can do for Randy. He is in great pain. I love him. If it is your will, show me what I might do to bring him peace.”

Dave looked up. Randy was watching him from the bottom of the stairs.

“Amen,” Dave said. He smiled. “Hey, bud.”

Randy said nothing. He stood looking at Dave.

Dave got to his feet.

“Man, this sucker hurts,” he said. “What are you up to?”

“You screamed,” Randy said. He did not move from his spot on the stairs.

“I burned myself,” Dave said.

“I came down.”

“Thanks,” Dave said. “I’m okay.”

Randy snorted. He shook his head and went back upstairs.
