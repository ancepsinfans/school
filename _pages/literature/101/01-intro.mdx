## Literature is a treasure trove.

You know the cliches: it's a door into another world, a window into <Def content='tester' user={user} location={path}>another mind</Def>, an escape from the world you live in. Even in spite of the fact that these are cliches — and we _should_ be wary of cliche! — there is truth to these statements.

Reading is an activity that expands your mind, if you let it. The frustrating thing is that there's a hundred reasons why you might not be able to.

1. It's hard to find the time.
2. It's impossible to choose what you should read in the sea of options out there.
3. Even when you've chosen something, it can be difficult to engage with the text.

These are real concerns. Do you find yourself struggling with any of these?
